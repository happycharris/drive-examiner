# drive-examiner

<p>Drive Examiner lists all the files of any given folder. This tool is effective at auditing and monitoring the contents of a folder. This toll is particularly useful for auditing the sharing permissions of all files. Additionally, by being able to list all files, folder contents can be tracked through time and any recent changes to the folder tree can be documented. </p>
